These instructions assume Linux.  Should be easily implemented on any of the
commercial Unices after you edit to suit your local configuration.

*** client install ***

There are two available client side daemons for PostChecker.  Choose only
one; both provide identical functionality.  Both daemons need to run as 
root, or a user that can access the Postfix spool queues.

The first is a shell program that leverages xinetd/inetd to run as a daemon.
If you need better performance (monitoring more than 10 servers, for example),
or you don't run xinetd/inetd, choose the compiled client.

*** shell code install ***

Copy queue_counts.sh to your favorite local bin directory.  Edit the POSTCONF variable to point to your local copy of postconf.

Add the following line to your /etc/services file:

postchecker     7678/tcp                        # PostChecker port

Copy the postchecker.xinetd.sample file into your /etc/xinetd.d directory and edit the following lines to taste (after renaming the file to postchecker):

only_from       = 127.0.0.1
server          = /path/to/queue_counts.sh

Once everything is in place, you should reload xinetd:

 # service xinetd reload

*** compiled code install ***

The compiled code makes several assumptions.  It assumes that your local Postfix spool directory is /var/spool/postfix, and that you're going to monitor the active, deferred, corrupt, and hold queues.  Change to suit your local environment.

You'll also need to configure a list of IP addresses that are allowed to connect to the daemon.  If you'd like to do without this (not recommended), change the RESTRICTED define to 0.

Once your local edits are completed:

# make
# cp queue_counts /usr/sbin
# chmod 755 /usr/sbin/queue_counts

Add the following line to your /etc/services file:

postchecker     7678/tcp                        # PostChecker port

Now to setup logging.  The daemon uses the syslog facility to log warning and informational messages.  I prefer to split those out, but you may have a different logging scheme.  The syslog messages are generated using the "LOCAL1" facility.  Since PostChecker is the only thing that logs at LOCAL1 (on my system)....

Add the following lines to your /etc/syslog.conf file:

# PostChecker
local1.*			/var/log/postchecker.log

Note that there are tabs between local1.* and the logfile name.

# touch /var/log/postchecker.log
# service syslog restart

Some additional configuration will be needed if you want the logs rotated, etc. 

Unless you plan on starting the daemon manually, you'll also need to perform the following tasks (RHEL example).

# cp queue_counts.initd /etc/init.d/queue_counts
# chmod 755 /etc/init.d/queue_counts
# chkconfig --add queue_counts
# service queue_counts start
# service queue_counts status

Assuming everything is OK, you should see something similar to the following after you run the status check:

[root@localhost client]# service queue_counts status
queue_counts (pid 4419) is running...
[root@localhost client]#

If not, (and you setup logging already), check your logfile for problems.

Finally, the critical system test.  From an allowed IP address:

# telnet <client name> postchecker

If you see something like this, you're good to go:

[root@localhost main]# telnet <client name> postchecker
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1).
Escape character is '^]'.
active:5
deferred:5
corrupt:0
hold:0
Connection closed by foreign host.
[root@localhost main]#

If you don't see something similar to that, check your log files for errors.
