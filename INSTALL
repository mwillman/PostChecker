FORMATTED FOR 80x25


These instructions assume Linux on the client and server side.  Should be
easily implemented on any of the commercial Unices after you edit to suit your
local configuration.


Prereqs

The following must be installed to use Postchecker

Server

- webserver (Apache, etc)
	http://www.apache.org
- PHP (5.X or 4.X) with GD support compiled in
	http://www.php.net
- jpGraph (2.X for PHP 5.X or 1.X for PHP 4.X)
	http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/index.php

Client

- Postfix (any version should work fine)
	http://www.postfix.org


Client Install

See the INSTALL document in the $POSTCHECKER_ROOT/client directory


Server Install

	These instructions assume you want to use all of the front-ends, and
that you've installed and tested a webserver, PHP, and jpGraph.

	Create a cache directory under your webroot that the user your
webserver is running as can write to.  This directory will hold the graphs
that are generated by PostChecker.  PostChecker doesn't delete the transient
graphs (generated by postchecker_web.php) yet, so for now that's on you.

	The simplest way to start postchecker_server.php on system boot is
to add the following lines to your (S99|rc).local file:

# startup PostChecker server daemon
/path/to/postchecker_server.php &

	Make a directory for PostChecker to live in, /usr/local/postchecker for
example.  The directory should hold the following files:

	- postchecker.cfg
	- postchecker_core.php
	- postchecker_cli.php
	- postchecker_server.php

	While the user that your webserver runs as doesn't need to write to this
directory, it does need to read from it.  The third front-end,
postchecker_web.php, needs to live in a directory under the webroot that you
can see with a browser.

	Edit postchecker.cfg to taste, following the sample instructions.
All the front-ends need to know where to find postchecker_core.php, and 
postchecker_core.php has several options that need to be configured before
it's usable.  Notably the location of your jpGraph installation, and the
directory names for your graph cache directory.

	Finally, postchecker_(cli|server).php need to know where to find the
PHP cli binary.
