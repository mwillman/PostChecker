These instructions assume Linux on the client and server side.  Should be easily implemented on any of the commercial Unices after you edit to suit your local configuration.

*** Prereqs ***

The following must be installed to use Postchecker

Server

- webserver (Apache, etc)
	http://www.apache.org
- PHP (5.X) with GD support compiled in
	http://www.php.net
- jpGraph (2.X)
	http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/index.php

Client

- Postfix (any version should work fine)
	http://www.postfix.org

*** client install ***

See the INSTALL document in the $POSTCHECKER_ROOT/client directory

*** server install ***

These instructions assume you want to use all of the front-ends, and that you've installed and tested a webserver, PHP, and jpGraph.

Create a cache directory under your webroot that the user your webserver is running as can write to.  This directory will hold the graphs that are generated by PostChecker.  PostChecker doesn't delete the transient graphs (generated by postchecker_web.php) yet, so for now that's on you.

The simplest way to start postchecker_server.php on system boot is to add the following lines to your (S99|rc).local file:

# startup PostChecker server daemon
/path/to/postchecker_server.php &

Make a directory for PostChecker to live in, /usr/local/postchecker for example.  The directory should hold the following files:

	- postchecker.cfg
	- postchecker_core.php
	- postchecker_cli.php
	- postchecker_server.php

While the user that your webserver runs as doesn't need to write to this directory, it does need to read from it.  The third front-end, postchecker_web.php, needs to live in a directory under the webroot that you can see with a browser.

Edit postchecker.cfg to taste, following the sample instructions.  All the front-ends need to know where to find postchecker_core.php, and postchecker_core.php has several options that need to be configured before it's usable.  Notably the location of your jpGraph installation, and the directory names for your graph cache directory.

Finally, postchecker_(cli|server).php need to know where to find the PHP cli binary.
